# Pi-Kiosk - Displays at DPO Office

To help display the results of the projects by DPO, we are testing and adding new technologies at our office. 

## Video Kiosk

We are using a Raspberry Pi as a video kiosk. It allows us to showcase the videos produced for our projects at a very low cost. In addition, the kiosk can be easily automated and updated as needed. For more details:
